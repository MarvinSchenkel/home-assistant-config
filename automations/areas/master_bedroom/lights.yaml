description: >-
  Controls the lights in the master bedroom.

  - When it is dark, the lights:
     - Turn on to bright and cool during the day
     - Turn on less bright and warmer in the evening

  - When I get in bed after 9:30pm, the ceiling light turns off and the bedside table
    lights dim, setting a nice scene for going to sleep.

  - Whenever we go to sleep, the lights stay off

  - We can still turn the bedside table lights on/off, even when we're in sleep mode

  - Manual control is used to disable automation when we override the default behaviour
